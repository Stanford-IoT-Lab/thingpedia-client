0.2.0
=====

* API change: HttpClient.lookupEntity was changed to return an object with `data`
  and `meta` properties, rather than an Array with a `meta` property; this is for
  compatibility with JSON serialization
* OAuth 2.0 helpers are now applied to all devices, if a different OAuth implementation
  is not provided
* Generic REST devices support more parameter types, and therefore are compatible
  with more APIs

0.1.0
=====

* First public release
