## Knowledge for your Virtual Assistant

Thingpedia is the open, crowdsourced knowledge base for virtual assistants.
Anyone can contribute the interface code to access any device or
web service to Thingpedia.

This package contains the client side libraries to retrieve and
instantiate the interface code from a public Thingpedia instance.

Thingpedia is part of Almond, a research project led by
prof. Monica Lam, from Stanford University.  You can find more
